Teaching computing concepts through a "gameified" command line.
This is an open source project by Joel Peckham and Professor Robert Ordóñez of Southern Adventist University.

# how to run on local system

First clone or download the project.

For gameterm to run correctly, the gameterm-master directory must be hosted by an HTTP server.
This can be easily achieved by changing your working directory to the gameterm-master directory then running the command:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer

After the HTTP server is running, http://0.0.0.0:8000/index.html may be opened in your browser.
